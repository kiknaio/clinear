# Contributing to Linearis

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

First up, because sadly its necessary: Fascists and brownshirts (US ICE etc.) need not apply. If you like what they do, and/or if you think "your people" are better than "the others", then get fucked, go rage your dick off over on X instead. This here is not a place for you.

**Everyone else:** Welcome! 🖖🏼

## Before You Start

**Bug fixes and small improvements** – PRs welcome! Feel free to dive in.

**Larger features or changes** – Please open an issue first to discuss. This is an opinionated tool, so not every feature fits.

**Questions or problems** – Open a GitHub issue.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/czottmann/linearis.git
cd linearis
npm install
npm start  # Development mode (no compilation needed)
```

**Note:** `npm install` runs GraphQL codegen which fetches the schema from `api.linear.app`. An active internet connection is required for the initial setup.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run build               # Compile TypeScript
```

Integration tests require `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` in your environment.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure tests pass (`npm test`)
4. Submit your PR

## Linearis is opinionated, because its maintainer is

I wish times were better and I wouldn't have to mention it, but they aren't and unfortunately, I do:

This tool is made by friendly people for friendly people. We aim to treat eachother with respect and tolerance. [We have zero tolerance for intolerance.](https://medium.com/extra-extra/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376) This is not open for discussion.
